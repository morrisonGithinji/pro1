<div class="me">
    <p>
Most people would describe me as solivagant ...a solitary adventurer,<br/>someone who wanders and travels the world alone.
<br/>A loner.
</p>

<p>
I'd prefer to view myself as a thinker ...a dreamer ...a human being cursed with their own thoughts,<br/>
thoughts of greater things that span to galaxies farther than the Milky way...farther than the stars and reaching into <br/>
multiple other dimensions.
</p>

<p>
    Who am I?<br/>
    What is my purpose?<br/>
    What is existence?<br/>
    These questions often spark a madness in me ...an urge to learn all the secrets of the universe...<br/>
    the desire to know all.
</p>
 <p>
Well...ABOUT ME...I speak three languages <br/>
<ol>
    <li>English
    </li>
    <li>Swahili</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>A little bit of Kalenjin</li>


</ol>

I have two pets , a cat and a dog ,Sally and Peanut.<br/>
I love taking pictures of sunsets.
 </p>
  
<p>
I have a passion for the arts.I learnt music from a young age and can play the guitar and a little bit of the piano.<br/>
I enjoy singing and painting ...I prefer painting to sketching.<br/>My favourite book is ''sunne in splendour' by Sharon Penman.<br/>
Writing is something I do to pass time...when I was eight I wanted to be a writer ,so you can imagine how many unseen manuscripts are on my 
book shelf.
</p>

 <p>
     I like stretching beyond my capacities and pushing my limits.This is one of the reasons I chose to learn programming .<br/>
     To temper my mind and to keep it active.
